The EIE aims to simplify the process of establishing an emissions baseline and identifying tangible reduction opportunities, providing the foundation for effective action. The EIE uses exclusive Google data sources and modeling capabilities to generate activity, emissions, and reduction opportunity estimates. By providing environmental information on a robust, free platform, we aim to serve decision-makers and researchers working on these issues and solutions for cities worldwide.",
